# SWTime
This is a very basic app to show the time.  

It was a fun project to learn the basics of SwiftUI for the Apple watch family.

There are two short videos showing the watch in use and a few screen shots, the code is provided here - I am no programmer, just an old guy with a love for learning, so feel fee to adapt (improve) the code.
